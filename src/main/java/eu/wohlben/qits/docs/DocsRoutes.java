/**
 * The reading surface, at {@code /docs}.
 *
 * <p>Four routes and one idea: turn a URL a person can hold in their head into a version-addressed
 * one, then stream the file qits-artifacts has under it.
 *
 * <p><b>Everything this service adds beyond the passthrough is a redirect</b>, and that is a
 * decision rather than an economy. A documentation bundle refers to its own assets
 * <em>relatively</em> — Storybook emits {@code ./assets/…} — so what a browser has to end up on is
 * a directory URL, or every asset resolves one level too high and 404s. Serving content at {@code
 * …/2026.807.0} instead of redirecting to {@code …/2026.807.0/} would produce a page that loads and
 * is then blank, which is the failure mode hardest to read. So {@code /docs/<site>} and {@code
 * …/-/<version>} both answer 302 and nothing else.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code latest} is a query, not a pointer.</b> There is no alias table here and no state at
 * all: the newest version is the first element of qits-artifacts' own version list, read on every
 * request. That is what lets a redeploy of this service lose nothing and a published version become
 * the latest the instant it lands.
 *
 * <p>The redirect to a version is <b>302, deliberately, not 301</b>. What {@code /docs/<site>/}
 * means changes with every release, so a permanent redirect would pin a reader's browser to
 * whatever version was newest the first time they visited, for as long as their cache lives.
 *
 * <p><b>Raw Vert.x routes, and responses built as bytes or headers.</b> Nothing here is serialised
 * by binding, so this stack adds zero native-image configuration — the rule qits-artifacts' four
 * wire packages follow.

   *
   * <ul>

   *       (one alphanumeric segment, a perfectly good site name) and 404'd every asset.
   *   <li><b>Below 40 000</b>, so the SPA fallback cannot answer a bundle path with {@code
   *       index.html} at 200. The ignored prefix says the same thing a second way.
