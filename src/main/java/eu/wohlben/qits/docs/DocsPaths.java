/**
 * The route grammar for {@code /docs}.
 *
 * <p><b>It is deliberately the same grammar qits-artifacts serves under {@code /artifacts/docs}</b>
 * — the {@code /-/} separator between a multi-segment site name and its version, and the same
 * character classes. A reader's URL and a publisher's URL differ only in their prefix, so a version
 * copied out of a release log resolves here by pasting rather than by translating, and nothing in
 * this service has to convert one shape into the other.
 *
 * <p><b>Every group here is either {@code (?<name>…)} or {@code (?:…)}, never a bare {@code
 * (…)}.</b> vertx-web compares {@code Matcher.groupCount()} against the named groups it scraped out
 * of the pattern and silently falls back to positional {@code param0…paramN} when the two disagree
 * — so one stray capturing group breaks every {@code pathParam(…)} on that route, at runtime, with
 * no error anywhere.
 *
 * <p>Matching runs against {@code normalizedPath()}, which collapses dot-segments before routing —
 * so {@code ..} never reaches a handler and a file path cannot be walked out of its version.
 *
 * <p>What this service adds beyond the publisher's grammar is the two <b>reading</b> spellings:
 * {@link #SITE_LATEST}, which resolves to the newest version, and the trailing-slash form of a
 * version root. Both are redirects rather than content, because a documentation bundle's own HTML
 * refers to its assets relatively — so what the browser must end up on is a directory URL, and
 * anything that served content from a non-directory URL would give a page whose every asset 404s.

   * segment; since the client moved to the root of this service's own host it is at {@code
   * /read/**}, outside {@code /docs} entirely, so reserving the name here protected nothing. A site

   * <p><b>This is structural on purpose rather than a matter of route order.</b> Both are ordinary
   * site names as far as the character classes are concerned — {@code q/health/ready} is three

   * for a site called {@code q/health/ready}, answers 404, and the deployment's health gate never
   * goes green while the process is running fine. Registration order would also fix it, and would
   * keep being right only until someone reordered {@code DocsRoutes.init} for readability.

   * <p>Zero-width, so it costs the named-group count nothing — which matters, see the class
   * javadoc.
