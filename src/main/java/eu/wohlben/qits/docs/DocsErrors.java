/**
 * The error envelope: a status code plus a short plain-text body.

 * <p><b>Never HTML</b>, and here that is the load-bearing part rather than a preference. The client
 * is a browser rendering a documentation site, so an HTML error body is precisely what it will
 * display in place of the page that was asked for — a failed asset would come back looking like a
 * page. Quarkus installs {@code QuarkusErrorHandler} as the router's failure handler and it answers
 * with exactly that, which is why nothing here calls {@code rc.fail()}.
