/**
 * The one thing this service talks to: qits-artifacts' docs repository, over qits-net.
 *
 * <p>Hand-rolled {@code java.net.http} rather than a REST client, the rule every outbound call on
 * this platform follows: a client library is a reflection surface to register and an image to
 * carry, for four requests whose shapes are known.
 *
 * <p><b>The {@link HttpClient} is an instance field, not a static one.</b> That is not style — a
 * static client is constructed during native-image build and an {@code HttpClientFacade} in the
 * image heap fails the build. Four sibling services carry this same note; the rule travels with the
 * client rather than with the package.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here caches.</b> A published version is immutable and carries an immutable cache
 * header, so the browser and any proxy in front of this process do the caching that matters, and a
 * cache here would only add a place for {@code latest} to be stale. The one read that could
 * legitimately be cached is the version list, and it is deliberately not: it is what makes {@code
 * latest} mean the newest version *now*, which is the whole reason this service can hold no state.

   * {@code ?meta.git.branch.name=} filter a few lines down, and it belongs beside the code that
   * dials it. A deployment that could set it could point this reader at a repository nothing
   * publishes into.
   *
   * <p>{@code application.properties} already argues exactly this for the OTLP endpoint, which
