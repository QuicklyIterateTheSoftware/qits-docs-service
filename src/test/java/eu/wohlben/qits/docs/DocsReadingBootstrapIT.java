/**
 * <b>The front door, and the boot behind it.</b> The whole service as it is <b>packaged</b>, beside
 * a store — the one posture this repository's suite did not have before userflows arrived.
 *
 * <p>{@link DocsPathsTest} and {@link DocsUpstreamParseTest} are deliberately plain JUnit over the
 * two pure pieces (the route grammar, the version parse), which leaves everything <em>between</em>
 * them untested: that a route registered at {@link DocsRoutes}' order 20 000 really answers, that
 * {@code qits.docs.artifacts-url} really reaches {@link DocsUpstream}, and that the scope grouping
 * happens <i>here</i> and not upstream. All three are properties of the built artifact plus its
 * configuration, so nothing short of launching it can show them.
 *
 * <p><b>This class owns the boot, and its edge count is what says the boot was quiet.</b> The far
 * side's recording is cumulative with no floor and this class sorts first of every story class in
 * the fork ({@code …docs.DocsReadingBootstrapIT} before {@code …docs.stories.*}), so anything the
 * launched process asked the store before any story ran would land in this story's diagram. Exactly
 * two edges is therefore a claim about startup as much as about the catalog: <b>qits-docs dials
 * nothing when it starts</b>. It has nothing to dial for — no JWKS to fetch, no credential to mint,
 * no registry to reconcile, no cache to warm — which is the same statelessness that lets {@code
 * latest} mean the newest version <i>now</i>.
 *
 * <p>The far side is {@link StoryStore}, a real listener speaking qits-artifacts' docs plane, and
 * the recordings make each interaction assertable on <b>both ends</b>: the reader acted on the
 * answer, and the store really was asked.

      """
      A reader opening the documentation front door sees every published site arranged under its
      scope — a released component library under `@qits`, a sibling's userflow bundles under
      `@userflows`, and a name with no scope at all under a group of its own. qits-artifacts
      answers a FLAT list and is right to: a scope lives in a site's name, and deciding what it
      groups under is a reading choice, so it is this service's, and a different reader is free to
      make a different one.

      The unscoped group is the arm worth spelling out. A service documenting itself as `qits-docs`
      has no scope, and the choice is to group it rather than to hide it or to invent it a home —
      the client renders that group without a heading.

      The store is asked exactly once for all of it, and nothing is remembered afterwards. That is
      the whole of "this service holds no state and needs none": there is no cache to have been
      warmed, no second opinion to disagree with the first, and a bundle published a second ago is
      in the next answer.

      This is also the first story of the run, and the store's recording has no floor under it — so
      the two arrows below are every arrow that existed by the time it finished. Starting qits-docs
      costs the platform nothing: no key fetch, no credential, no reconcile.
