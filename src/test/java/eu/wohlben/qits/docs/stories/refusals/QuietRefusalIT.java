      """
      qits-docs holds no state, so almost every answer it gives is the store's. Three are not, and
      each of the three is a decision rather than an omission.

      A SCOPE IS NOT A SITE. `/docs/@userflows` is one segment beginning with `@`, which is a
      namespace and not something with a newest version to redirect to — so it is a 404 that says
      so, in plain text, decided from the URL alone. It used to fall through to a client page under
      this segment; the client is at the root of this service's host now and `/docs` is an ignored
      prefix, so the fall-through would have reached Quarkus' own HTML 404 instead — which is the
      one body shape this service must never produce, because its client is a browser assembling a
      website and would render it in place of the page that was asked for.

      A MISSING `?site=` IS A 400. The version list is addressed by query parameter because a site
      name spans path segments, and a request that names no site is malformed rather than pointing
      at nothing. Asking the store for the versions of `null` to find that out would be a round trip
      spent confirming what the request already said.

      AND THE TRAILING-SLASH REDIRECT ASKS NOTHING. `/docs/<site>/-/<version>` answers 302 to the
      same path with a slash on it, without checking that the version exists: the target answers
      that itself, and asking twice would cost a reader a round trip to be told the same thing. It
      is the route a browser hits on the way into every bundle it opens.

      So: three requests in, three answers out, and a store that was up and recording every call it
      received was never dialled. That absence is the story — and it is what a presence check could
      not have said.
