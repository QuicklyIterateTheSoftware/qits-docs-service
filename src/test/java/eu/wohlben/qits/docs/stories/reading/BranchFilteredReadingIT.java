      """
      A userflows bundle is published once per commit, so one site holds versions from several
      branches at once and a reader on a work branch wants the one their branch produced — not the
      one that shipped. `/docs/api/versions?site=…&branch=…` is that question.

      qits-docs does not answer it. The branch is pushed upstream as qits-artifacts' own metadata
      filter, `?meta.git.branch.name=`, and the store's matching AND ordering stay the single source
      of truth for "the branch's latest". Filtering the full list here would be a second opinion
      that can disagree with the store's, over data this service does not own — and it would still
      be wrong the moment the store learned a filter this one had not.

      The branch name is percent-encoded on the way, and the outgoing arrow shows it:
      `environment/dev` leaves as `environment%2Fdev`. That is not decoration — a branch name is a
      query VALUE off the reader's own query string and can carry `/`, `#` and spaces, unlike the
      site path beside it, whose character classes exclude every one of them.

      The third read is the one that has to be an ANSWER rather than a refusal: a site the store
      knows, filtered to nothing, is 200 with an empty list. A branch-latest probe has to be able to
      render "no bundle for this branch yet", and a 404 there would say the site does not exist.
      The unfiltered-and-empty case does not arise at all — a site exists only by having a bundle
      published under it — so no 404 arm is lost.

      All three go out on the same route, and the diagram draws them as one incoming arrow: a
      query never reaches a label. What each read asked for is a step; where this service went to
      get it is the arrow.
