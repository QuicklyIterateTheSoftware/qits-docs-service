/**
 * <b>Publish, then read — the whole arc, both ends.</b> A release publishes a documentation bundle
 * into qits-artifacts, and a reader opens it: catalogue, version resolution, two redirects, the
 * entry point and one asset. Nine arrows, two initiators, and one component in the middle that
 * remembers none of it.
 *
 * <p>The publish is a real {@code PUT} onto the store's docs plane, from outside this process. That
 * matters: <b>"a version published a second ago is already the newest" is not a claim a pre-seeded
 * fixture can make</b>. The list is read before the publish and again after it, and the arrow into
 * the store is identical both times — no invalidation, no warm-up, no second address — because
 * there is nothing here that could have gone stale.
 *
 * <p>The two redirects are the whole of what this service adds beyond the passthrough, and they are
 * different from each other in a way the diagram shows: the first costs a store read (a 404 for a
 * site nothing is published under is worth answering before a page load), the second costs
 * <b>nothing at all</b> — the version is not checked to exist, because the redirect target answers
 * that itself and asking twice would cost the reader a round trip to be told the same thing.

      """
      A release of the component library publishes its Storybook workbench into qits-artifacts, and
      somebody opens it. That is the whole product: `docs.<env>.<domain>/docs/@qits/ui-components`
      and you are looking at the newest release's workbench.

      `latest` is a QUERY, not a pointer. There is no alias table here, no `latest` tag and nothing
      to keep in step: the newest version is the first element of qits-artifacts' own version list,
      read on every request. So the list read before the publish and the one after it are the same
      request to the same address, and the answer changed because the store's rows did. A redeploy
      of this service loses nothing, because there was nothing to lose.

      Then two redirects, and they are not the same redirect twice.

      `/docs/@qits/ui-components` is the HUMAN entry point and lands on the reader — the client at
      `/read/<site>`, which has the version picker on it. It used to redirect straight to the newest
      bundle directory, which served a full-viewport Storybook with no rail: opening a doc took the
      version picker away, and the one URL a person would paste was the one that could not switch
      version. It still costs one store read, because a 404 for a site nothing is published under
      is worth answering before a page load rather than inside one.

      `/docs/@qits/ui-components/-/2026.830.0` redirects to the same path with a TRAILING SLASH,
      and that slash is load-bearing rather than tidy. A documentation bundle refers to its own
      assets relatively — Storybook emits `./assets/…`, which is what makes a bundle
      location-independent and publishable as an artifact at all — so the browser has to end up on
      a DIRECTORY url, or the page loads and is then blank with every asset 404ing one level too
      high. It is 302 and not 301 for the same reason `latest` is a query: what `/docs/<site>/`
      means changes with every release. This one asks the store NOTHING.

      Both files then come through byte for byte, with the upstream's content type and ETag
      untouched — and with the ONE header this service replaces rather than forwards. Every URL
      here is version-addressed, so its bytes can never change, but `index.html` is what a `latest`
      redirect lands on: a browser holding it for a year would keep rendering an old release's
      entry point after following a redirect to a new one. So the entry point revalidates and
      everything the bundle references is immutable, and only this service knows which of the two
      URLs the reader is on.
