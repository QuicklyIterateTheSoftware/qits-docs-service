/**
 * The one launched qits-docs, addressed the way every one of its surfaces is addressed — and named
 * the way a diagram names it.
 *
 * <p>This service has <b>one</b> plane and it is all under {@code /docs}: the machine surface
 * ({@code /docs/api/**}), the bundle wire ({@code /docs/<site>/-/<version>/**}) and Quarkus' own
 * non-application root ({@code /docs/q/**}, from {@code quarkus.http.non-application-root-path}).
 * The client Quinoa serves is at the host root and is not a surface any story here drives — every
 * story runs against a build with {@code -Dquarkus.quinoa=false}, so there is no bundle to serve.
 *
 * <p><b>The port is random</b> — failsafe launches the artifact with {@code
 * quarkus.http.test-port=0} — so nothing here is a constant except the paths, and RestAssured is
 * handed the port by the Quarkus integration-test extension.
 *
 * <h2>The shipped tap's default skip is right here, and it was checked</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link eu.wohlben.qits.userflows.NetworkTaps#restAssured(String)} skips any path carrying a
 * {@code /q/} <b>segment</b> rather than a leading one. This service's probes live at {@code
 * /docs/q/health/ready} — nested under {@code /docs}, which is exactly the case the segment rule
 * exists for — and no route of this service can contain a {@code /q/} segment, because {@code
 * DocsPaths.NOT_RESERVED} refuses {@code q/} as the first segment of a site name and no fixture
 * bundle here has a {@code q} directory in it. So no story class overrides the predicate.
 *
 * <h2>Authored literals and generated ids, on purpose</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link Labels} rewrites only the path segments it can tell were generated — a uuid, a long hex
 * run, a bare number — and this catalogue puts <b>both</b> kinds in one diagram set on purpose, so
 * the two rules are visible side by side:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A <b>userflows</b> bundle is version-addressed by the <b>commit sha</b> that produced it —
 *       forty lowercase hex characters, a whole path segment, so {@code Labels} rewrites it to
 *       {@code {digest}} and the label stays a template rather than moving with every publish. That
 *       is the right answer: the sha is run-local to the pipeline.
 *   <li>A <b>released</b> bundle is version-addressed by a <b>CalVer</b> string ({@code
 *       2026.830.0}), which is authored and survives a label verbatim — and it should, because
 *       {@code /docs/@qits/ui-components/-/2026.830.0/} is a URL a person pastes.
 *   <li>An asset inside a bundle carries a content hash <b>inside</b> its segment ({@code
 *       assets/main-a1b2c3d4.js}). {@code Labels} correctly refuses to rewrite that — it is not a
 *       whole segment — so the fixture's hash is <b>authored</b>. An id embedded in a segment has
 *       to be, or the {@code networkHash} moves every run with no symptom but a diff.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>A query string never reaches a label from the shipped tap.</b> It labels {@code METHOD
 * <scrubbed PATH> -> <status>} and drops the query entirely, which is load-bearing here: {@code
 * /docs/api/versions} is asked unfiltered, branch-filtered and filtered-to-nothing in one story and
 * all three draw <b>one</b> edge. What the reader asked for is a step; where this service went to
 * get it is the outgoing edge, and {@link StoryStore} deliberately keeps the query on <i>that</i>
 * side — see its javadoc.

   * A request onto the <b>reading</b> routes, sent the way a browser sends one.
   *
   * <p>Two settings, and both are corrections of a RestAssured default that does not match any real
   * client:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><b>{@code urlEncodingEnabled(false)}</b>. RestAssured percent-encodes {@code @} in a path
   *       to {@code %40}; no browser and no {@code curl} does, because {@code @} is perfectly legal
   *       in a path segment. It matters here because a site name usually <i>starts</i> with one,
   *       and {@code DocsPaths}' character classes admit no {@code %} — so an encoded request does
   *       not match the site route at all and falls through to Quarkus' own HTML 404. Sending the
   *       path verbatim is what makes these stories about this service rather than about its test
   *       client. The {@code /docs/api/**} routes are unaffected and keep the default: they are
   *       addressed by query parameter, where encoding is correct and Vert.x decodes it back.
   *   <li><b>{@code redirects().follow(false)}</b>. Everything this service adds beyond the
   *       passthrough <i>is</i> a redirect, so what the browser is told is the answer under test —
   *       and following it would draw an arrow at a client that is not even built in a {@code
   *       -Dquarkus.quinoa=false} run.
