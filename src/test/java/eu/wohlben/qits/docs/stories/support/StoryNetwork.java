/**
 * <b>Both ends of every diagram in this catalogue, wired in one call</b> — so a story class's
 * {@code @BeforeAll} is one line and no class can wire half of it.
 *
 * <p>There are two feeds, and they are two different mechanisms:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>the near side</b>, {@link NetworkTaps#restAssured}: every request a story makes becomes
 *       {@code <actor> -> qits-docs}, labelled {@code METHOD <scrubbed path> -> <status>}. The
 *       framework ships it; this repository's hand-copied {@code StoryNetworkFilter} was deleted
 *       when these stories were written. It is idempotent per service, which is why every class may
 *       call this method. Its default skip — any path carrying a {@code /q/} segment — was checked
 *       against this service's own {@code quarkus.http.non-application-root-path}; see {@link
 *       StoryTarget}.
 *   <li><b>the far side</b>, {@link StoryStore#install()}: the store's access log, cumulative and
 *       with <b>no floor</b>, which is what lets the first story's edge count say that the launched
 *       process asked the store nothing at boot.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>There is no third feed and there could not be: qits-docs talks to exactly one thing. That is
 * the whole architecture — "the store answers what exists, this service answers what to read" — and
 * a diagram set in which every story has the same single far side is that sentence, drawn.
 *
 * <h2>Order is load-bearing, and it is the class names that carry it</h2>
 *
 * <p>A cumulative source is attributed by a cursor, so anything recorded before the first drain
 * lands in whichever story drains FIRST. {@code UserflowClassOrderer} sorts by fully-qualified
 * class name, so {@code …docs.DocsReadingBootstrapIT} runs before every {@code …docs.stories.*}
 * class and owns the boot; within {@code stories}, {@code reading} runs before {@code refusals}.
 * {@code @UserflowRunsAfter} states the ones that are real dependencies as well as being true of
 * the names — the catalog story reads the store <i>before</i> anything publishes into it, and that
 * is a dependency rather than a coincidence of spelling.
