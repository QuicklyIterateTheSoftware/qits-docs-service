/**
 * <b>Four ways the store can fail a reader, and four different things to say about them.</b> The
 * flip side of holding no state: everything qits-docs says about what exists, it says on the
 * store's authority — so every way that can go wrong has to come out looking different, or a reader
 * is sent to the wrong place.
 *
 * <p>The line that matters is <b>404 versus 502</b>. 404 means the URL names nothing and whoever
 * typed it should go and fix the URL; 502 means the failure is behind this process and whoever is
 * debugging should go and look at qits-artifacts. Collapsing them is the most expensive wrong
 * answer a component in the middle can give — and reporting either one as an <i>empty catalogue</i>
 * would be worse still, because an empty shelf is the reading a documentation site can least afford
 * to invent.
 *
 * <p>Three of the four are 502, and they reach it by three different routes through {@code
 * DocsUpstream}: a status it read and refused, a body it could not parse, and a socket that never
 * answered. The outgoing labels are what tell them apart — {@code -> 503}, {@code -> 200} and
 * {@code -> no answer} — which is why the store's recording carries the status it answered with and
 * not only what it was asked.

      """
      A site the store has never heard of is a 404, passed through: the URL names nothing, and the
      reader is the one who can fix it. Everything else here is a 502, because the failure is behind
      this process — and the three of them are three genuinely different failures that this service
      must not be able to tell apart by guessing.

      The store ANSWERS SOMETHING ELSE. A 200 carrying valid JSON that is not a version document is
      the one failure a reader could otherwise mistake for content: parsed far enough to prove it is
      JSON, it is not the shape promised, and the honest answer is "qits-artifacts said something I
      cannot read".

      The store IS UP AND CANNOT SERVE. A 503 on the catalogue is not an empty catalogue. This is
      the arm the whole story is named for: a component in the middle that answered `{"scopes":[]}`
      here would be telling a reader that nothing is published, which is a lie that reads exactly
      like the truth. And it is not hypothetical — the readiness probe of this service is
      deliberately the STOCK one, because a health check that dialled qits-artifacts would take this
      container down for an outage it is designed to survive by answering 502. Surviving it means
      saying so.

      The store ACCEPTS THE CONNECTION AND SAYS NOTHING. The other arm of the same exception, and it
      arrives as an IOException rather than as a status this service read. The reader gets the same
      502, and the diagram does not: the outgoing arrow says `no answer`, which is what the store's
      own recording knows and no status could have said.

      All four bodies are PLAIN TEXT, and here that is load-bearing rather than a preference. The
      client is a browser assembling a website, so an HTML error body is precisely what it renders
      in place of the page that was asked for — a failed stylesheet would come back looking like a
      page. Nothing in this service calls `rc.fail()`, because Quarkus' own failure handler answers
      with exactly that.
