/**
 * <b>qits-artifacts' docs plane</b> — the one thing qits-docs talks to — as an in-JVM stand-in,
 * plus the <b>outgoing</b> tap that draws what the launched process asked it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a stand-in of one API rather than a generic mock</h2>
 *
 * <p>qits-docs holds no state at all: everything it answers, it answers on the store's authority.
 * So the store <i>is</i> the fixture, and the stories only mean something if the far side really
 * has the shape qits-artifacts has. This one does, in the four places a generic canned-JSON mock
 * cannot reach and where every story in this catalogue lives:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>the {@code /-/} grammar</b>: a site name spans up to four path segments and usually
 *       starts with {@code @}, so a route here is <i>parsed</i> ({@code
 *       <site>/-/<version>[/<path>]}) rather than matched against an exact string;
 *   <li><b>the query</b>: {@code ?meta.git.branch.name=} is the store's own metadata filter, and
 *       the whole point of the branch story is that qits-docs <i>pushes it upstream</i> rather than
 *       filtering locally — which is unobservable unless the far side answers differently for it;
 *   <li><b>real bytes</b>: a bundle file has a content type and an {@code ETag}, and both are
 *       pass-through decisions this service makes on a route where it replaces {@code
 *       Cache-Control}. Answering everything as {@code application/json} would make the reading
 *       stories prove a store that does not exist;
 *   <li><b>the upload</b>: {@code PUT <root>/<site>/-/<version>} is how a bundle gets here at all,
 *       and "a version published a second ago is already the newest" is not a claim a pre-seeded
 *       fixture can make.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>One stated liberty.</b> The real upload takes a gzipped tarball and explodes it; this one
 * takes a JSON manifest of {@code path → content}. The URL, the {@code X-Artifacts-Meta-*} headers
 * and the 201 are faithful — those are what qits-docs and the publishing pipeline actually agree on
 * — and nothing in this service ever sees the request body, so the tarball is the one part of that
 * exchange no story here could observe.
 *
 * <h2>The recording, and who each edge is FROM</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every answered request is appended to a file as {@code METHOD TARGET STATUS} — before the
 * response is written, so a line is on disk by the time its effect is observable — and {@code
 * TARGET} carries the <b>query</b>. That is deliberate and it is the one place this catalogue
 * differs from its siblings' peer stubs: the shipped RestAssured tap drops the query on the way
 * <i>in</i> (so three differently-filtered reads are one incoming edge), which would leave the
 * branch filter invisible in both directions if the outgoing half dropped it too. It is safe to
 * keep: {@link Labels} rewrites a query value only where it can only have been generated (a uuid, a
 * long hex run), so an authored branch name survives verbatim — percent-encoding included, which is
 * itself the evidence that {@code DocsUpstream.branchQuery} encoded it.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code from} is decided by the method, and that is a fact about the system rather than a
 * convenience.</b> qits-docs only ever <i>reads</i> the docs plane — it has no write path at all —
 * so a {@code GET} recorded here can only be this service, and anything else can only be the
 * pipeline that publishes bundles. Two initiators, told apart by construction.
 *
 * <p><b>There is no floor</b>, unlike the naive shape of this pattern: the recording is wiped when
 * the stub starts and the stub starts inside this run, so everything in it belongs to this run. A
 * floor taken at the first {@code @BeforeAll} would swallow anything the launched process asked
 * before the first story — and the first story's {@code assertEdgeCount} is precisely the assertion
 * that <i>nothing</i> did, which a floor would turn from a claim into an artefact.
 *
 * <h2>Stateless per request, with two deliberate exceptions</h2>
 *
 * <p>The catalogue is state, and it has to be: a publish has to change what the next read answers,
 * which is the whole subject of two stories. It lives in this class's static tables, mutated only
 * over the wire (a real {@code PUT}), so the <b>classloader split does not reach it</b> — a test
 * profile is instantiated in more than one classloader, and only the copy that started the server
 * holds the tables. Everyone else asks over HTTP, which is what a store is.
 *
 * <p>The second is {@link #refuse} / {@link #hangUp}, and it is spelled as a <b>file</b> for the
 * reason the sibling repositories spell it as one: no story-controlled value reaches these paths in
 * a way an outage could key on — "the store is down tonight" is a property of the store, not of the
 * site somebody asked for — and the arming story lives in a different classloader from the server.
 * Written by the one story about an outage, in a {@code try}/{@code finally} that always clears it,
 * wiped again when the stub starts, and read fresh on every request.
